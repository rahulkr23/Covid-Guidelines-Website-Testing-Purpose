                    Q: What are the symptoms of the coronavirus disease?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: The most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and even death. The period within which the symptoms would appear is 2-14 days.

                    Q: What is the recovery time for the coronavirus disease?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Using available preliminary data, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.

                <p>
                    Q: How long does the coronavirus last on surfaces?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.
